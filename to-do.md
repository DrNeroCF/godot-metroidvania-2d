# META task: Missing base systems, components, or mechanics to complete the demos

* created by @NathanLovato on 2019-06-09 03:50:17 +0000 UTC * assignees: NathanLovato  This issue is to help me keep track of what main parts of the project are still missing

- [x] Health component
- [ ] Combat: taking damage, damaging enemies, death
- [ ] Respawn and checkpoints
- [ ] AI system and Enemies
- [ ] Level design
- [ ] Visuals
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Transition between frames

# Level design: design connected frames to teach basic movement

* created by @NathanLovato on 2019-05-31 02:51:40 +0000 UTC * assignees: NathanLovato  Notes:

- Need to set up a tilemap to quickly draw the layout of levels and get collision shapes
- There's currently no code to move between frames or scenes

# Camera: soft snapping to anchors

* created by @NathanLovato on 2019-05-31 02:43:44 +0000 UTC * assignees: NathanLovato  Add support for anchors towards which the camera can softly lerp, to help guide the player to points of interest. E.g. a new ability to unlock.

# Write a contribution guide

* created by @NathanLovato on 2019-05-02 01:45:52 +0000 UTC * assignees: NathanLovato  We need a guide so people know when and what they can contribute. During the prototyping phase, feedback and testing would be useful and welcome. Any serious work would be welcome at any stage, anything that helps the project move forward: implementing different mechanics, level design, etc.

I'd just like all the work to be ticketed and the scope to be well-defined so we don't go overboard with features. Right now it's just a little too early. We need to have a clearer direction and target for the demo.

From @henriiquecampos:
